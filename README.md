Hello Everyone!

Ryan here, I like to learn coding.  I used to be decent at it, but let time and new career directions get in the way of
keeping my skills at a peak level.  I want that to change.  I want to be a decent coder and get a job doing front end
dev work.  Thanks for reading this little blurb about me!
